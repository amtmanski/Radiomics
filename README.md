## 1. Simple neural network - digits recognition
Data set form MNIST. This simple, linear model can to predict hand-written digits with 95% accuracy

## 2. Convolutional neural network - digits recognition
The only difference between first one is the model

## 3. Image Recognition with ResNet18 - model from torchvision package
CIFAR10 dataset was used to train model.

Accuracy of the model for test dataset: 71.94%

Accuracy for each class:  
Accuracy of airplane:	  84%  
Accuracy of automobile:	85%   
Accuracy of bird:		    77%  
Accuracy of cat:		    53%
